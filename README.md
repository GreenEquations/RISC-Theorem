Recursive Information Saturation Collapse Theorem (RISC)
Overview
The Recursive Information Saturation Collapse Theorem (RISC) proposes that any recursive symbolic processing system—whether artificial (e.g., neural-symbolic systems, deep learning models) or biological (e.g., human cognition)—will experience collapse when the interplay between recursive feedback and entropy imbalance exceeds a critical threshold. This collapse manifests as a degradation in coherence, symbolized by phenomena such as logical contradictions, semantic drift, or hallucinations.

This repository contains the theorem's formalization, supporting scientific argumentation, testable predictions, and simulation design proposal. It is intended for researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in understanding how recursive symbolic systems can fail under certain conditions.

Theorem Statement
Core Idea
The theorem states that recursive symbolic systems experience collapse due to the combination of entropy imbalance and recursion density. This collapse occurs when these two factors exceed certain thresholds, resulting in degraded system performance, including issues like semantic drift and logical paradoxes.

Where:

H(t) = entropy imbalance (difference between incoming entropy and dissipated entropy),

D_r(t) = recursion density (measures the depth of recursive symbolic references),

Φ(t) = coherence function (tracks the system's ability to maintain symbolic integrity),

α and β = constants that modulate the impacts of entropy imbalance and recursion density on coherence,

Θ = entropy threshold,

θ_c = recursion density threshold.

Collapse Condition
The system undergoes collapse when either entropy imbalance exceeds Θ or recursion density surpasses θ_c, leading to nonlinear degradation in coherence.

Theory and Background
The RISC theorem builds upon multiple theories:

Thermodynamics of Computation (inspired by Landauer’s Principle),

Information Theory (entropy imbalance),

Recursive Systems Theory (recursive feedback loops),

Cognitive Science and AI (recursive paradoxes and information overload).

Testable Predictions
In AI Systems (e.g., Transformers, Neural-Symbolic Models): Increased recursion density will degrade the system's semantic coherence.

In Human Cognition: Exposure to recursive paradoxes (e.g., liar paradox, Curry’s paradox) leads to cognitive overload.

In Neural Networks (e.g., Spiking Neural Networks): Increased entropy or recursive inputs will result in collapse in output coherence.

Simulation Design
The theory suggests testing the model with:

AI Testing: Use transformer models or neural-symbolic systems to apply recursive tasks and measure semantic coherence.

Human Testing: Present paradox chains to human subjects under cognitive load and measure response time and semantic consistency.
