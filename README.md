# 🔄 Recursive Information Saturation Collapse (RISC) Theorem

## Overview

This repository presents the **RISC Theorem**, which formalizes a collapse condition in symbolic systems that encounter excessive internal information density and recursive feedback. When a system exceeds its entropy handling capacity or its allowable recursion depth, it enters a state of semantic breakdown. RISC is applicable to both artificial intelligence and human cognition, particularly in contexts involving recursive logic, language generation, or symbolic overload.

## 🔢 Key Terms

- **Φ(t)** – A coherence function measuring output consistency at time t
- **H(t)** – Entropy imbalance, defined as the difference between incoming and dissipated symbolic entropy
- **Dr(t)** – Recursion density: the rate of internal symbolic referencing over time
- **Θ** – Critical entropy threshold
- **θc** – Recursion threshold
- **Collapse Condition** – When either H(t) > Θ or Dr(t) > θc, coherence degrades rapidly and Φ(t) accelerates downward

## 📉 Collapse Indicators

- Decrease in Φ(t) and acceleration in d²Φ/dt²
- Mutual information between system outputs drops toward zero
- Entropy spikes (e.g., Shannon or cross-entropy)
- Self-referential loops begin to contradict or overwrite original semantics
- Redundancy or hallucination increases in output
