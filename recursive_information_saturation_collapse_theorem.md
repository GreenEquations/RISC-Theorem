# ðŸ”„ Recursive Information Saturation Collapse Theorem (RISC)

## I. Theorem Statement

The RISC Theorem describes a collapse condition in symbolic systems where either recursive feedback or information entropy exceeds the systemâ€™s handling capacity. The model defines two measurable failure thresholds â€” one for entropy accumulation and one for recursion depth.

Let:
- **Î¦(t)** â€“ Coherence function at time t
- **H(t)** â€“ Entropy imbalance (input vs. dissipation)
- **Dr(t)** â€“ Recursion density (recursive operations per time unit)
- **Î˜** â€“ Critical entropy threshold
- **Î¸c** â€“ Recursion collapse threshold

**Collapse is triggered if:**

    H(t) > Î˜   or   Dr(t) > Î¸c

At this point, the coherence function degrades rapidly:

    dÂ²Î¦/dtÂ² > 0     and     Î”I(t) â†’ 0

## II. Collapse Mechanism

1. **Entropy Saturation**  
   The system receives more symbolic information than it can meaningfully process or dissipate.

2. **Recursive Overload**  
   Internal referencing increases symbolic pressure beyond capacity, leading to contradiction or degradation.

3. **Feedback Amplification**  
   Attempted self-correction increases recursion density, worsening entropy and semantic drift.

## III. Collapse Indicators

- Acceleration in coherence loss: dÂ²Î¦/dtÂ² increases
- Mutual Information approaches zero
- Entropy rises over time (Shannon or cross-entropy)
- Output becomes repetitive, contradictory, or nonsensical

## IV. Simulation Design

### Applicable Systems

- Transformer-based language models
- Symbolic systems with internal recursion
- Cognitive models simulating recursive symbolic reasoning

### Metrics

- Semantic coherence (e.g., BERTScore, BLEU)
- Mutual Information between outputs
- Cosine distance of latent embeddings
- Entropy change across cycles

## V. Visualization

- Recursion density curves compared to Î¸c
- Collapse prediction using dÂ²Î¦/dtÂ² and Î”I(t) trajectories

## VI. Cognitive Parallel

- Symbolic overload in human reasoning
- Working memory failure under recursive load
- Contradiction loops in paradoxical thought or belief structures

---

## VII. Applications

- **AI Model Design**: Embed entropy and recursion monitors
- **Cognitive Science**: Model breakdown in recursive symbolic tasks
- **Architecture**: Add recursive fail-safes to symbolic reasoning systems
- **Safety Tools**: Predict symbolic collapse from Î”I(t), H(t), or Î¦(t) metrics

## VIII. Future Work

- Model entropy inflow/dissipation as a function of recursion depth
- Implement recursive dampening layers in generative architectures
- Expand collapse thresholds to multi-agent symbolic systems
